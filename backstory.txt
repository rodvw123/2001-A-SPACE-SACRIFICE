"The ULS Galactic Cockswoggler was christened in the fourth space-month of the 
24XXth space-year of our space-savior Jesse L. Nova-Christ.  At eight hundred 
and ninety thousand metric space-tons the Galactic Cockswoggler is the fourth 
largest colony ship in the galactic fleet.  Named after General E. B. 
Cockswoggler-Hypernova, the most decorated soldier of Space-World War IV, she 
continues the proud tradition of hundreds of years of space-navy work for the 
greater human good. Tasked with spreading humankind to the far edges of space 
the Swoggly was sent off to colonize the probably uninhabited Gliese 667 Ce. 
Struggling onwards she has reached the last leg of her XX year voyage and 
success is in sight.  Her brave crew and unwitting passengers have endured many 
space-tragedies that would have crushed a lesser crew.  Unknown to the men, 
women, and chrimen of the ship damage has accumulated over the years. The 
Swoggly has sustained severe system damage and may not make the journey.  Deep 
within the purpose built computer core the artificial space-intelligence boots 
and prepares to save the ship and her good crew..."
